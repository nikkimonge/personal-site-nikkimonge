            How I Came To Love Taylor Swift

            My two older sisters went to Taylor Swift's 1989 Concert without me.
            I was jealous. My cousin happened to have two extra tickets and gave
            them to my 2 sisters because they were fans. I was never invited. I
            was sad. My sisters said it was because I didn't listen to Taylor's
            music. They were fans, and I was just a "local." I've listened to
            her music on the radio and whenever my sisters played it, but other
            than that I never really listened to her music on my own. To be sure
            I would get an invite next time, I listened to Taylor's music on
            repeat for months. I did my research on her. I invested so much time
            learning about Taylor and figuring out who she is. So when the album
            "Reputation" came out, I was a huge fan. I spent the next 6 months
            listening to the album on repeat, memorizing lyrics and relating to
            the songs. It wasn't until Christmas when I learned that I was,
            finally, invited to the Reputation concert. Since then, I've loved
            her music and memorized the lyrics to all 7 of her albums.
